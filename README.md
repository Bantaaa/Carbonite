# Carbonite

Carbonite is a Java console application designed to help users track and manage their carbon consumption. In an era where environmental awareness is crucial, Carbonite provides tools for individuals to measure, monitor, and analyze their carbon footprint.

## Project Context

As awareness of the environmental impact of human activities grows, tracking and managing carbon consumption becomes increasingly important. Carbonite aims to develop a Java console application that allows users to measure and monitor their carbon footprint while providing analysis tools to better understand their consumption habits and encourage more environmentally friendly behaviors.

## Objectives

Create a simple yet functional console application that allows users to manage their profile, track their carbon consumption, and analyze their consumption habits. Introduce and apply basic Java concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP), to lay the groundwork for more advanced features in the future.

## Features

1. **User Account Management**
   - Create new user accounts
   - Modify existing account information
   - Delete user accounts securely

2. **User Information Display**
   - View carbon consumption details for each user
   - Display user information in a clear, card-like format

3. **Intuitive Console Interface**
   - Present information clearly and accessibly

4. **Consumption Calculation**
   - Automatically calculate total carbon consumption for each user
   - Real-time updates to reflect the latest data entries

5. **Consumption Analysis**
   - Generate carbon consumption reports (daily, weekly, monthly) [Coming Soon]
